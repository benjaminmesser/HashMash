    <h3>Character Offset</h3>

    <p>
        A character offset is a way of adding an initial bit of randomness into the message before it gets hashed fully. It works by taking the <a href="representing-letters">ASCII</a> encoding of each character of the message, and adding the offset number to it (as ASCII encodings are just 2-digit hexadecimal numbers). For example, the message "hello",
        when bit shifted by 2, reads as "jgnnq", which doesn't bear much resemblance to the original message. However, this is a pretty rudementary technique, and can be reversed rather easilly, so it should never be
        all you do when trying to make a hash function.
