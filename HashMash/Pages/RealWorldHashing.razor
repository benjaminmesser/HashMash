    <p>
        Originally developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). SHA-256 which stands for Secure Hash Algorithm, is a Cryptographic Hash Algorithm. Specifically, SHA-256 was created as the second generation of Secure Hashing Algorithms after SHA-1 was compromised. SHA-256 has yet to be compromised and has been widely accepted by the public as a trusted Hashing Algorithm.

    <p>
        There are a few variants of SHA-2, all of which differ based on the constant output bit size. In particular, SHA-256 is a hashing Algorithm that outputs a Hash Value of a fixed-length of 256 bits.
